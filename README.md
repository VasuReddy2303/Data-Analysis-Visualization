ðŸ“Š Operational Budget Analysis and Visualization â€“ Rutgers University

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Rutgers Universityâ€™s operational budget data. 

Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, I examined trends in revenue, expenses, transfers, and non-operating assets across various organizational levels : campuses, units, divisions, and departments.

I developed interactive dashboards that allow users to explore financial patterns at multiple levels, providing data-driven insights and recommendations to support strategic budget management and planning.
